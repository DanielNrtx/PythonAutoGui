I got tired of the monotomous time spent doing homework in a useless class so I created a program that speaks with Chatgpt API by sending pictures and receives 
information back that the program then uses opencv and pyautogui to click through steps to figure out the type of problem and how to organize it to click specific 
points then for correct and wrong answers clicks the required buttons to move on.
